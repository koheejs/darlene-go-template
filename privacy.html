              questions or suggestions or if you participate in blogs, forums,
              message boards, chat rooms, profile pages and other services to
              which you are able to post information, if any, through the
              Services (collectively, “Forums”). We may also collect Personal
              Information through certain features of one or more of the GOcxm
              Services (and in some instances will allow you to opt- out of such
              collection or retention of certain Personal Information). In some
              instances, certain products or services do not have to be in
              active use in order for your Personal Information to be collected
              through them.

              disclosure of Personal Information before or at the time of
              collection. We will only collect Personal Information with your
              consent. The collection of Personal Information will be limited to
              that which is necessary for the purposes identified by GOcxm when
              it seeks consent for the collection of information. Any change of
              purpose will be communicated to you and a new consent obtained. We
              will document all purposes for the collection of Personal
              Information. Receiving consent will not be a condition of
              supplying the Services, unless the information requested is
              required to fulfill an explicitly specified and legitimate
              purpose. Individuals may withdraw their consent at anytime and
              GOcxm will explain to individuals the implications of withdrawing
              their consent. Personal Information will be as accurate, complete
              and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to
              be used.

              only keep your Personal Information for as long as it remains
              necessary or relevant for the purposes stated above or as

              maintain your personal information in secure data storage to
              safeguard it from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Our soft
              copy data storage will be protected by the appropriate
              technological measures (e.g. passwords and encryption) and any
              hard copies of Personal Information will be kept in locked filing
              cabinets or kept in offices with restricted access. In the event
              that you believe you may be the victim of identity theft or other
              illegal conduct, please contact the appropriate federal,
              provincial or local law enforcement agencies directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Individual Access to Information:</strong> You have the
              right to access, verify and update your Account Information and
              preferences at any time, including whether you want GOcxm to
              contact you about specials and new products. You may request
              deletion of your GOcxm account by contacting the Privacy Officer
              and verifying your identity. Upon request and following
              appropriate identification of the requestor that is satisfactory
              both to GOcxm and under PIPEDA, an individual will be informed of
              the existence, use and any disclosure of his/her Personal
              Information. The individual will be given access to that
              information if requested. A reasonable administration fee may be
              charged to supply the information. The approximate cost of the
              administration fee will be communicated to the individual prior to
              the release of the information.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the Personal Information held by GOcxm is inaccurate, GOcxm
              shall amend the information as required. In limited circumstances,
              GOcxm may refuse an individual access to their Personal
              Information; however, access will only be refused in accordance
              with PIPEDA or other applicable laws. For instance, if the
              Personal Information is protected by solicitor-client privilege,
              or would reveal confidential commercial information, GOcxm may
              refuse access to such information. Products Offered in Partnership
              with Third Parties and Third Party Links: In general, GOcxm’s
              Services access third party information (such as your Facebook
              account information) through application interfaces. GOcxm may
              provide links to third-party Web sites, such as Facebook, as a
              service to our users. GOcxm may also carry advertisements from
              other companies. When you click on links of third parties on a
              GOcxm site or in an application, you may leave the site or
              application. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded
              with our name/logo or our affiliated entity's name/logo, even
              though they are not operated or maintained by us. This Policy does
              not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy practices
              of Web sites operated by third parties, whether they are linked to
              or otherwise accessible from a GOcxm website or the Services. The
              inclusion of a link or accessibility of third party Web sites does
              not imply endorsement of such third party Web site by us. Opting
              Out of Marketing-Related Communications: You may opt out from
              receiving marketing-related emails, texts, phone messages or other
              communications from GOcxm on a going-forward basis by indicating
              so where requested or otherwise contacting GOcxm as set out below.
            </p>
            <p>
              GOcxm will try to comply with your opt-out request as soon as
              reasonably practicable. Please note that if you opt out as
              described above, this will apply to marketing messages from GOcxm
              only. GOcxm will not be able to remove your Personal Information
              from third parties to whom you have previously authorized GOcxm to
              share such information (i.e., to which we have already provided
              your Personal Information as of the date that we implement your
              opt-out request). Please also note that if you do opt-out of
              receiving marketing-related messages from us, GOcxm may still send
              you important administrative messages, and you cannot opt-out from
              receiving administrative messages.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Changes in Practices:</strong> GOcxm will keep this
              Privacy Policy current. GOcxm will inform you of any changes that
              it makes by updating this Privacy Policy accordingly and amending
              the date first written above to reflect the date of changes. In
              addition, GOcxm will inform you by e-mail that its Privacy Policy
              has changed.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Children:</strong> GOcxm assumes that if you are legally
              providing us with credit card information that you are an adult or
              are otherwise authorized to do so. We encourage parents and
              guardians to participate in their children's activities and to
              supervise them when they access on-line resources. We do not
              knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age
              of 13. No information should be submitted to or posted on GOcxm
              sites by users under 13 years of age. If a child under the age of
              13 submits Personal Information to GOcxm sites, we will delete the
              information as soon as we discover it was provided by a child
              under 13 years of age. We will not and do not use such information
              for any purpose.
